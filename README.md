# Extended Essay Fractals

For my International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme Extended Essay, I chose to write about how fractals are formed through iterated function systems and measured through the similarity and the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension methods. This repo will contain some of the fractals studied, which were generated through Python.

## Koch Curve


## Binary Tree

Another example is the symmetric Binary Tree, a more flexible type of fractal as it works for any angle θ where
0° < θ < 180° and any scaling factor S where 0 < S < 1. To generate the simplest version of this fractal, a vertical
line segment of length 1, or also called trunk, will split into two branches at the top that form an angle of θ with the
linear extension of the trunk (Riddler, 2022). For the first branches, each has length S. Following that, each of these
two branches split into two more branches (also called the second branches) with length S2. From this, a subtree is
formed at every branch
